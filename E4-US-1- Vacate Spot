As a parkee, I need to be able to vacate a spot once I am finish using it so that other parkees can use it.
1.	Verify I am able to vacate a spot once I am finish using it so that other parkees can use it.
2.	Verify a button is available in the application to vacate the spot I am currently parked in.
3.	Verify the vacated spot is now available for other parkees to use.
4.	Verify I cannot vacate spots that I am not using.
