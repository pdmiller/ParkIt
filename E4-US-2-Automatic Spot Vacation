As a parkee, I need to be able to vacate a spot automatically after a 12 hour period, so that spots become available for other parkers.
1.	Verify I can vacate a spot automatically after a 12 hour period, so that spots become available for other parkers
2.	Verify the automatically vacated spot is made available for use by other parkees.
3.	Verify the spot is not automatically vacated if a parker confirms the spot is still in use.
