As an application admin, I need to be able to configure the number of hours the system uses to automatically vacate spaces.
1.	Verify I am able to configure the number of hours the system uses to automatically vacate spaces.
2.	Verify I can enter a range from 0 to 24 hours, to set the number of hours to expire a parking spot.
3.	Verify that when an expiration time of zero is entered, the parking spot never expires.
4.	Verify the parking spot becomes available after the number of hours passes.
5.	Verify I cannot enter more than 24 hours in the expiration admin option.
